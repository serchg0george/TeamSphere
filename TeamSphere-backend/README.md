## Overview

TeamSphere is a RESTful web application designed to manage multiple aspects of a user system. Built using Java 21 and Spring Boot, it leverages PostgreSQL for persistence and offers robust authentication with JWT and role-based access control. The application provides comprehensive CRUD operations and dynamic search capabilities across various domains such as positions, projects, roles, timesheets, companies, departments, and employees.

## Features

- **Authentication & Security**  
  - JWT-based authentication with endpoints for registration and login.
  - Role-based access control (e.g., ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER).

- **CRUD Operations**  
  - Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for positions, projects, roles, timesheets, companies, departments, and employees.

- **Dynamic Search**  
  - Search endpoints that use JPA Criteria Builder for flexible, type-safe queries.
  
- **Tools**  
  - Lombok to reduce boilerplate code.
  - Integrated validation using Spring Boot Starter Validation.

- **Documentation**  
  - Swagger/OpenAPI integrated for interactive API documentation.

## Technologies in Detail

- **Spring Boot & Spring Security:**  
  These frameworks form the backbone of the application. Spring Security manages authentication and role-based authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users with proper roles can access sensitive endpoints.

- **JWT:**  
  JSON Web Tokens are used for stateless authentication. After login, users receive a token that must be included in subsequent requests.

- **JPA & Hibernate:**  
  The API uses Spring Data JPA along with Hibernate for ORM. All CRUD operations are handled through JPA repositories.

- **Criteria Builder:**  
  For search endpoints, the API uses the JPA Criteria Builder to create type-safe and dynamic queries at runtime. This allows flexible filtering of data without hardcoding SQL queries.

- **Lombok:**  
  Lombok to reduce boilerplate code.

- **Maven:**  
  Dependency management and build processes are handled with Maven.
